<p><strong><em>A 19 year old California girl has revealed that she escaped a sex cult led by Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr. The young girl says she wandered the streets of San Francisco seeking out little girls to deliver to Karr. According to her, Karr's followers are numerous in number and are willing to kill for him.</em></strong></p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) May 29, 2010 -- In 2007, the FBI launched an investigation after being alerted that John Mark Karr was organizing a sex cult. Three years later, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel says she fears for her life as she makes a break from what she describes as a dangerous cult capable of murder. Spiegel says the name of the cult is &quot;The Immaculates&quot; so named after Karr's past references to perfect little girls he has known.</p>
<p>Karr was thrust back into the news when ex-girlfriend Brooke Simmons Dovgan exposed what was thought to be Karr's new identity that has since become questionable. Over the months following the revelation, Spiegel, who says she was once a student of Karr's, has alleged that she was threatened through phone conversations and e-mail transmissions.</p>
<p>Karr stated, &quot;I have made no such threats and would wish no harm to come to this girl or anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>Karr, who has had little to say in response to the serious cult allegations, told Lei Sussurra that he submitted a statement to CNN though there is no indication that the statement was ever aired. It is as follows and was posted on the sidebar of the Lei Sussurra site earlier this week:</p>
<p>&quot;It can never be proven that I am a cult leader who instructs my followers to kill my enemies and seek out little girls for my exploitation. I am amazed that reputable media would grant airtime, much less credence, to any random person who makes unsubstantiated wild claims against a private citizen with no proof whatsoever to back up the lies that are flowing from them. As I have stated in the past, I am the subject of a witch hunt that has dragged me from my private life with the intent to display me to the world like some strange oddity stuck through with a straight pin in my enemies' collection.&quot;</p>
<p>A perplexed Karr says of Spiegel, &quot;I believe Samantha is being pressured to say these things about me. This is not the Samantha I have known and loved. I have always had such a deep respect for this girl. I am shocked by what she is doing now but do not hold her responsible. Instead, I believe she is being influenced by outside forces. I understand she has gone through a very difficult time in her past. I wish for her the best and hope sincerely that she will finally come down from this extraordinary media ride with the realization that I am still in support of a better life for her.&quot;</p>
<p>Although media organizations report that authorities are searching for Karr, there is no evidence that there is an arrest warrant for the one time murder suspect of a six year old girl. Seattle Weekly responded earlier this week to a virtual all points bulletin for Karr that was released by Fox News during a story about Samantha Spiegel's involvement in Karr's cult:</p>
<p>&quot;Fox claims that police in San Francisco are looking for Karr and have &quot;asked Seattle law enforcement for help&quot; in finding him. But Seattle police are saying the opposite. &quot;We got a bunch of calls on this a couple months ago,&quot; says spokesman Mark Jamieson, &quot;but we don't have anything on (Karr).&quot; San Francisco's district attorney is singing a similar tune. &quot;At this point, there is no case to review for charging,&quot; says spokeswoman Erica Derryck.&quot; (Seattle Weekly)</p>
<p>Samantha Spiegel was the subject of Lei Sussurra's 2009 article titled &quot;Karr's Royal Romance&quot;. According to sources, Spiegel is a wealthy San Francisco girl with high society connections. She was a student at a posh private school for girls in San Francisco where Karr was a teacher in 2000. Spiegel claims to have been one of Karr's students though Karr states that he does not recall the girl as a child. Karr and Spiegel were reported to have had a romantic relationship prior to his exit from the U.S. in 2008 though Karr has never confirmed it. Sources revealed that she lavished Karr with expensive gifts and gave him moral support as he prepared to leave the country.</p>
<p>In 2009, Lei Sussurra reported in an article titled &quot;Karr Contemplates Creation of Cult&quot; that Karr has already been looked at by U.S. federal authorities for the possible organization of a cult. Furthermore, Karr has already been investigated by the Department of Homeland Security in 2006 for international child sex trafficking. In the same year, Manson family prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi discussed the similarities between Karr and Charles Manson who led his cult of young girls to kill, amongst others, Sharon Tate Polanski who was nine months pregnant at the time. If Karr rivals Manson and now leads a sex and death cult in some international location with murderous sleeper cells located throughout the U.S. and the world, it can be guaranteed that after Spiegel's public revelation, the FBI and every other international law enforcement agency has already commenced an investigation to confirm or discount the existence of &quot;The Immaculates&quot;.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF SUBJECT</h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
