<p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) July 4, 2011 -- Is JonBenet Ramsey suspect John Mark Karr glaring in disgust at his reflection or glued to himself in narcissistic delight? Artists Jason and Carlos Sanchez traveled from Canada to the United States in 2007 to capture the timeless pose of the &quot;monster in the mirror.&quot; Critics hate the blowup, not for their dislike of the artists' work but for their disgust for John Mark Karr as a person.</p>
<p>Wrinkled faced and twenty pounds heavier, spectators might need to read the title to recognize the evil face in the &quot;who's the fairest of them all&quot; rendition of Ramsey killer, John Mark Karr. This is not the slimmer, more feminine Karr remembered from the overly exposed media coverage of the murder suspect in 2006. The shirt should be familiar as the one worn by Karr on his extradition flight from Bangkok to Boulder beneath a burgundy tie, now in possession of a one time Karr confidant who divulged to Karr's enemies that she had it along with other Karr collectibles.</p>
<p>The exhibited work might spark protest from the citizens of the conservative southern California seaside city. Santa Barbara is the cite of deceased President Ronald Regan's ranch with such notable homeowners as Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, and Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>The Santa Barbara Museum of Art's <a href="http://blog.sbma.net/2011/05/exhibition-preview-new-faces-of-the-collection" target="_blank">New Faces of the Collection</a> exhibition opened on May 28, 2011 with twenty-seven new photographic additions to the museum's collection. John Mark Karr was a gift of the Catharine Clark Gallery in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-seven new faces along with John Mark Karr is the work <a href="http://www.helnwein.com/werke/photo/bild_3145.html" target="_blank">Modern Sleep 1 2004</a> by artist <a href="http://www.helnwein.com" target="_blank">Gottfried Helnwein</a> whose work has depicted dead little girls in such works as his Last Child series of 2008 seen <a href="http://www.helnwein.com/werke/photo/bild_3148.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.helnwein.com/werke/photo/bild_3160.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.helnwein.com/werke/photo/bild_3151.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Helnwein was the artist who shot Karr favorite, <a href="http://www.helnwein.com/press/english_press/article_1167-Marilyn-Manson-Marilyn-Manson;jsessionid=EF0658D858FA41FBB8F2D9FB8C9F1427" target="_blank">Marilyn Manson's unreleased album art</a> that featured the shock rocker posed in Nazi attire with little girls in his lap handling a rifle or stroking the one that Manson held. Karr has told Lei Sussurra in the past that Helnwein's photographic artwork is amongst his favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Museum_of_Art" target="_blank">The Santa Barbara Museum of Art</a> ranks amongst the top ten regional art museums in the United States. <a href="http://www.sbmuseart.org/collection/index.web" target="_blank">The museum</a> exhibits works by such artists as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Renoir, and Rembrandt.</p>

<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
