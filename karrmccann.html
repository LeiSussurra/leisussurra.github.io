<p><strong><em>In chilling descriptions, an experienced Karr provides reasons why McCann's abductors might have spared her life.</em></strong></p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) September 10, 2009 -- A judge in Portugal has banned a book titled &quot;The Truth of The Lie&quot; wherein writer Goncalo Amaral efforts to convince readers that abducted child Madeleine McCann is dead. Many consider his conjecture to be a hindrance in solving a missing child case as opposed to a child murder case. John Mark Karr has said since her disappearance that McCann is alive based on what he refers to as his &quot;past experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can depend on my own background and international experience to come to a conclusion. I believe she’s alive for several reasons. I'm also not convinced that she was taken by a pedophile,&quot; Karr stated.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra has excerpted his theory from a rare radio talk show format entitled &quot;Deeper&quot;. In the November 2008 transcript, Karr expresses his belief that McCann was taken by crafty abductors with experience moving about Europe, undetected.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe she is and will remain in mainland Europe due my past experience moving through those countries over a period of several years. In the event that the kidnapper or kidnappers would need to change locations frequently to evade law enforcement, they could travel from country to country without having to present a passport. This was my experience for the two years I lived in various parts of Europe,&quot; Karr expressed.</p>
<p>In chilling descriptions, an experienced Karr provides reasons why McCann's abductors might have spared her life stating, &quot;I think she’s still alive because, quite simply, she was worth keeping alive. As harsh as that may sound, one must think as the abductor would think to understand what might've likely happened to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Karr further explained to Lei Sussurra that he believes a family wanting a child of their own might have paid an abductor to have her. Karr explained how easily McCann could integrate into a new family.</p>
<p>&quot;Madeleine was three when she was taken. She was taken young enough to rearrange her memory processes. At just under four, it’d be easy to reprogram her thoughts of her past family to that of another family or even another individual. Her memory of her parents and siblings at the time of her abduction could easily fade with the proper deprogramming,&quot; Karr explained.</p>
<p>Karr further explained why he thinks McCann, if alive, has not been found.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless she’s recognized by her physical attributes, there’s no way she can be identified. The abductors can produce a bogus birth certificate to obtain a passport. Passports are the premiere identity document in Europe. In my past experience working with children in Europe, they all had passports acquired by their parents,&quot; Karr explained.</p>
<p>Though Karr has been considered by some a threat to society, he went on to share his own ideas on methods of prevention.</p>
<p>&quot;This brings us to a measure that might be well considered in the future – mandatory fingerprinting of children with a database in place. In other words, when a parent makes an attempt to order an identity document like a passport, the child’s fingerprints have to be provided and compared to an international database. It could also be required to check fingerprints of children registering for school. It might sound extreme but it would tremendously help in the search for missing children who otherwise go right under the wire,&quot; stated Karr.</p>
<p>Karr abducted a twelve year old girl in America in 1983, taking her across state lines which would have resulted in the involvement of the FBI and considered a federal case had it been legally pursued. SWAT teams swarmed Karr's Atlanta home just moments after he left with the twelve year old girl to return her to her parents. Karr rendezvoused with a fifteen year old girl in 1988 prior to an elopement with her when she was sixteen. Karr was arrested on two counts of first degree murder and two counts of kidnapping of six year old JonBenet Ramsey in 2006.</p>

<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>
<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</h4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
