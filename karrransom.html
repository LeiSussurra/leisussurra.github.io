  <p><strong><em>John Mark Karr releases all four of the handwriting samples used by experts in 2007 to link him to the Ramsey ransom note. Karr reluctantly releases the never before seen samples after being tipped that they were slated to be sold to the tabloids.</em></strong></p>
  <p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) December 25, 2010 -- Lei Sussurra has received four <a href="karrwriting.html">John Mark Karr handwriting samples</a> used in the Linda Arnold, Travis King, Don Lehew and Curt Baggett handwriting analyses of 2007 that linked Karr to a ransom note left behind on the night of JonBenet Ramsey's murder. The experts swore they would testify in court that Karr authored the note that asked for a $118,000 ransom for the return of the six year old girl who was eventually found dead in the Ramsey home fourteen years ago tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Karr said, &quot;I didn't want to release these samples but it's better to be released here than to be sold by my enemies to the tabloids. I'm tired of people getting paid to hate me while dragging JonBenet's name through the middle of their bloody slaughter of John Mark Karr.&quot;</p>
<p>Karr says these are the four samples that he was encouraged to release to the experts in 2007 by those around him who convinced him it was &quot;the right thing to do.&quot; The samples were found in Karr's Atlanta and Alabama homes earlier that same year as the result of a thorough search. Karr confirmed that the original samples are in safe keeping.</p>
  <a href="karrwriting.html"><img src="images/KarrHandwritingSamplesJonBenetRamseyRansomNote_002.png" alt="writing" id="samples"></a><p>The most prominent of the samples, titled &quot;Certificate of Payment&quot;, appears to be a deal between Karr and a tenant. The verbose agreement was written in October 1982, fourteen years prior to the 1996 ransom note. It is now being released to the public fourteen years after the ransom note was written. The sample possibly contains the most small case letters in a single Karr document that has ever been released. It is not known exactly when Karr started authoring all handwritten notes and applications in all capital letters, making small case letter samples written by Karr extremely rare.</p>
  <p>Though experts link Karr to the 1996 ransom note, it does not prove that he killed JonBenet Ramsey. Lei Sussurra reported in an August 2009 article that &quot;various experts continue to concur that Karr wrote a ransom note that was held by law enforcement as physical evidence. Notably however, some of the experts expressed that, though they were convinced that Karr penned the ransom note, it did not prove that he murdered JonBenet Ramsey. The question might be posed that if Karr could be linked to such physical evidence by experts, does he know who did kill the Ramsey girl?&quot;</p>
  <p>In Karr's case, the media and others in 2006 discounted handwriting analysis as a serious method of connecting suspects to physical evidence. In stark contrast to the lack of importance placed on handwriting analysis in 2006, law enforcement asked for numerous handwriting exemplars from Patsy Ramsey who was not at the time in custody for the murder of her daughter as was Karr in 2006. Karr was never asked for an official handwriting exemplar though he did say that law enforcement asked him to write with his left hand while he was being interrogated in Bangkok in 2006. Handwriting exemplars were totally out of the question once Karr was back in America with proper legal representation that forbade it. Karr's Boulder attorney Seth Temin guarded Karr's handwriting in 2006 going as far as asking that the application he filled out upon arrival at Boulder County Jail be sealed from the public.</p>
  <p>In 2006, Karr's former classmate shared her high school yearbook with the world that contained an entry from Karr to her. The yearbook entry was the focus of certain handwriting experts who commented that Karr's handwriting was &quot;disguised&quot; or written with an artistic flair that can be seen in Karr's signature on the latest &quot;Certificate or Payment&quot; release. The remainder of the sample seems more naturally written.</p>
  <p>Karr doesn't seem concerned about the findings of the handwriting experts responding, &quot;You can link me to a ransom note but you fools squandered away what you had in 2006. You'll never get that far with me again. Thanks to all of you who screamed that I was a lunatic liar, I'm alive and not sitting on death row. Your shouts of &quot;liar, liar&quot; might as well have been shouts of &quot;save Karr's life&quot;. Now who's the conqueror?&quot;  </p>
