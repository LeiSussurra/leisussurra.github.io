  <p><strong><em>John Mark Karr releases all four of the handwriting samples used by experts in 2007 to link him to the Ramsey ransom note. Karr reluctantly releases the never before seen samples after being tipped that they were slated to be sold to the tabloids.</em></strong></p>
  <p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) December 25, 2010 -- Lei Sussurra has received four <a href="karrwriting.html">John Mark Karr handwriting samples</a> used in the Linda Arnold, Travis King, Don Lehew and Curt Baggett handwriting analyses of 2007 that linked Karr to a ransom note left behind on the night of JonBenet Ramsey's murder. The experts swore they would testify in court that Karr authored the note that asked for a $118,000 ransom for the return of the six year old girl who was eventually found dead in the Ramsey home fourteen years ago tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Karr said, &quot;I didn't want to release these samples but it's better to be released here than to be sold by my enemies to the tabloids. I'm tired of people getting paid to hate me while dragging JonBenet's name through the middle of their bloody slaughter of John Mark Karr.&quot;</p>
<p>Karr says these are the four samples that he was encouraged to release to the experts in 2007 by those around him who convinced him it was &quot;the right thing to do.&quot; The samples were found in Karr's Atlanta and Alabama homes earlier that same year as the result of a thorough search. Karr confirmed that the original samples are in safe keeping.</p>
  <a href="karrwriting.html"><img src="images/KarrHandwritingSamplesJonBenetRamseyRansomNote_002.png" alt="writing" id="samples"></a><p>The most prominent of the samples, titled &quot;Certificate of Payment&quot;, appears to be a deal between Karr and a tenant. The verbose agreement was written in October 1982, fourteen years prior to the 1996 ransom note. It is now being released to the public fourteen years after the ransom note was written. The sample possibly contains the most small case letters in a single Karr document that has ever been released. It is not known exactly when Karr started authoring all handwritten notes and applications in all capital letters, making small case letter samples written by Karr extremely rare.</p>
  <p>Though experts link Karr to the 1996 ransom note, it does not prove that he killed JonBenet Ramsey. Lei Sussurra reported in an August 2009 article that &quot;various experts continue to concur that Karr wrote a ransom note that was held by law enforcement as physical evidence. Notably however, some of the experts expressed that, though they were convinced that Karr penned the ransom note, it did not prove that he murdered JonBenet Ramsey. The question might be posed that if Karr could be linked to such physical evidence by experts, does he know who did kill the Ramsey girl?&quot;</p>
  <p>In Karr's case, the media and others in 2006 discounted handwriting analysis as a serious method of connecting suspects to physical evidence. In stark contrast to the lack of importance placed on handwriting analysis in 2006, law enforcement asked for numerous handwriting exemplars from Patsy Ramsey who was not at the time in custody for the murder of her daughter as was Karr in 2006. Karr was never asked for an official handwriting exemplar though he did say that law enforcement asked him to write with his left hand while he was being interrogated in Bangkok in 2006. Handwriting exemplars were totally out of the question once Karr was back in America with proper legal representation that forbade it. Karr's Boulder attorney Seth Temin guarded Karr's handwriting in 2006 going as far as asking that the application he filled out upon arrival at Boulder County Jail be sealed from the public.</p>
  <p>In 2006, Karr's former classmate shared her high school yearbook with the world that contained an entry from Karr to her. The yearbook entry was the focus of certain handwriting experts who commented that Karr's handwriting was &quot;disguised&quot; or written with an artistic flair that can be seen in Karr's signature on the latest &quot;Certificate or Payment&quot; release. The remainder of the sample seems more naturally written.</p>
  <p>Karr doesn't seem concerned about the findings of the handwriting experts responding, &quot;You can link me to a ransom note but you fools squandered away what you had in 2006. You'll never get that far with me again. Thanks to all of you who screamed that I was a lunatic liar, I'm alive and not sitting on death row. Your shouts of &quot;liar, liar&quot; might as well have been shouts of &quot;save Karr's life&quot;. Now who's the conqueror?&quot;  </p>

<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
