<p><strong><em>Karr as the charismatic leader of a sex cult surrounded by young female followers might seem far fetched but the FBI took it seriously. It might have been the oddest in a long line of investigations launched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security over the months and years following his 2006 arrest for first degree murder. Karr's attorneys advised that federal authorities would watch him for the rest of his life.</em></strong><br>
</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) September 20, 2009 -- When Manson Family prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi discussed Karr on international television in 2006, it could not have been known that soon the FBI would compare Karr to Charles Manson, not as a killer but as a cult leader. Karr's high school Civics teacher would not have thought that someday Karr would be compared to a psychopathic Jim Jones by federal authorities when years before, a young Karr turned in a school term paper on the charismatic preacher who led over 900 of his followers to mass suicide.</p>
<p>Karr described the bizarre cult investigation, that took place approximately a year after his arrest in 2006, involved a computer that contained chat conversations between himself and one of his contacts. Karr explained that the FBI entered an American family's home and seized the computer in question. From the chat sessions, the FBI derived that Karr was contemplating the formation of a cult that would be comprised of young girls. Karr would not impart a complete description including the events that led up to the investigation, citing self-incrimination.</p>
<p>Karr is from a long line of religious leaders. His father was a missionary evangelist once launching a church in Caribbean Jamaica. Karr's mother, a teen missionary herself, was the daughter of an evangelical preacher who started his own church in Central America's Guatemala until he was chased out by the political unrest of the 1970's.</p>
<p>In the months and years following his arrest for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, John Mark Karr was the subject of a number of federal investigations ranging from the serial murder of children to international child sex trafficking. In candid conversations, Karr reveals private talks with his attorneys that brought him to his knees as the result of a slue of investigations -- some that would have led to multiple extraditions to foreign lands with some offenses punishable by death.</p>
<p>Karr conveyed that, while he was still in Sonoma County Jail awaiting a child pornography trial, attorney Rob Amparan expressed to him that federal authorities would be watching him for the rest of his life. After his release and back in Atlanta, Karr stated that his attorneys gave him almost weekly accounts of new investigations being launched against him by federal authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;My attorneys were in talks with DHS trying to get my laptop back for one. According to my attorney Gayle Gutekunst, the Department of Homeland Security was investigating me for everything imaginable. It was an emotionally traumatic experience as I received news of one investigation after another,&quot; stated Karr.</p>
<p>In one such investigation, Karr was looked at for international crimes against children by the Department of Homeland Security, possibly in conjunction with international authorities such as Interpol. The authorities attempted to trace the steps of Karr's vast international travels from 2001 to 2006. According to his attorneys, one of the investigations revolved around the serial murder of little girls in every country he had lived in or visited in the five years leading up to his arrest for first degree murder.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure law enforcement got frustrated with all the gaps in my travels according to the visa stamps in my passport. While I was in Europe, for instance, I traveled from country to country without a visa stamp at all. In all the time I lived in Paris, there was not one visa stamp for France. They missed a lot,&quot; stated a seemingly sly Karr.</p>
<p>The idea of Karr as a serial child killer was likely revisited by law enforcement following a chilling message allegedly sent by Karr on Christmas night 2008 wherein he stated that he had killed little girls internationally.</p>
<p>Another of the investigations regarded what the Department of Homeland Security supposedly considered a child sex ring logically centered in Thailand. Karr's location at the time of his arrest in 2006 raised the eyebrows of authorities for its reputation as a center for the trafficking of children for sex. Authorities believed Karr was doing more than teaching second grade in the capitol city of Bangkok. DHS would reach yet another dead end and again, Karr would arise unscathed.</p>
<p>Obviously Karr was halted in his attempt to organize a cult comprised of young female followers or was he? Since there is no knowledge of his current whereabouts nor of the current goings on in his life, could it be that Karr is in some tropical utopia carrying out an old family tradition? Without a doubt, U.S. federal authorities and international law enforcement will certainly make it a point to find out.</p>

<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
