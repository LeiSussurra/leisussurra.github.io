<p><em><strong>Vigilantes take the law into their own hands to track and trace John Mark Karr who has never been convicted of a crime is not wanted by authorities.</strong></em></p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL (COF) January 4, 2011 -- For years, there has been an anti-Karr group consisting of retired law enforcement agents, computer analysts and civilians. It is located mostly across the southeast but extends into other parts of the U.S. The group has followed Karr since 2007 or earlier. Activity from the group is most saturated in the southeast and includes Acworth Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; Tallahassee Florida; Palm Harbor Florida; Port Richey Florida, and Miami Florida. Other areas include San Francisco California; Las Vegas Nevada; Patchogue New York, and Bainbridge Island Washington.
<p>The head of the group is the owner of an internet website security company based in Florida and lives in Acworth, Georgia. The head contacted Karr by telephone for the first time in 2007. The head posed as a true friend to Karr for months and engaged in hours of phone conversations with him. The head tapped phone conversations without Karr's permission and shared them with his closest contacts in 2008, ie. Brooke Simmons and others interested in Karr, possibly including John Ramsey and Melinda Ramsey, law enforcement and retired law enforcement across the country.</p>
<p>The head of the group supplied Karr with an internet website that he named johnmarkkarrnow.com. Karr operated an internet forum for a time on the jmknow.com site. The head publicized the website as JMK's personal site to Fox News and other news media. The head deceived Karr into believing the site belonged to him when in reality, it was set up to snare him through his own admissions. The site was taken from Karr in 2008 and later used against him to distribute information about him and trace and report his whereabouts. The site alexisvaloranreich.com, named after one of two court ordered name changes in 2008 for Karr, replaced the jmknow.com site and is thought to be owned by the same person.</p>
<p>The head of the group encouraged Karr to release four handwriting samples in 2007. The head financed the project that employed two handwriting experts, Travis King and Linda Arnold, to prove Karr's involvement in the murder of JonBenet Ramsey. The head told Karr at the time that she believed him to be the Ramsey killer.</p>
<p>The head of the group launched an internet e-mail sting operation against Karr in 2008 after Karr's departure from America. Karr lived in Europe at the time. The head posed as a French family in need of a nanny. During the e-mail exchange, the head received the names of Karr's relatives whose children were cared for by Karr in 2007 and 2008. The relatives were contacted by the head.</p>
<p>The group was responsible for uncovering two name changes for John Mark Karr that took place in Seattle, Washington in 2008. The name change was sold to the tabloid, the National Enquirer, by Brooke Simmons after information was turned over to her or discovered by her as a member of the group.</p>
<p>The groups' efforts are ongoing.</p>

<h4 align="center" style="color: #600">SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
