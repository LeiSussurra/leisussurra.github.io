<p><strong><em>Mother Nature's winds might have further cleared John Mark Karr in the Ramsey murder if they destroyed physical evidence neglected by law enforcement in 2006 who did not make any effort to search the Alabama residence Karr lived at when JonBenet Ramsey was murdered.</em></strong></p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL (Lei Sussurra) May 2, 2011 -- If Karr's Alabama home was destroyed or partially damaged by last week's tornadoes, will law enforcement be prompted to take another look at the possibility of searching the home of the only man arrested for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey? During the 2006 internationally exposed arrest of Karr for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, neither his Alabama or Atlanta homes were searched by law enforcement. Karr revealed to law enforcement in 2006 that he was withholding physical evidence. Why did U.S. authorities neglect to search the home Karr resided in when JonBenet Ramsey was murdered? Law enforcement will still require a search warrant in 2011 though possible Ramsey case evidence might be strewn in every direction.</p>
<p>During Karr's taped revelations of the Ramsey murder with CU professor, Michael Tracey, Karr revealed that he had hidden a small box, referred to by Karr as &quot;the gothic box.&quot; Karr revealed that the box held JonBenet's underwear, a knife used to cut cord, a garrote used on JonBenet's neck, and a lock of JonBenet's hair. Karr has spoken of the &quot;gothic box&quot; to Lei Sussurra for two years suggesting that it is hidden in an international location. He has suggested that the box has been moved and hidden in new locations since 1996. Is it possible that Karr has misled us to believe this and that instead, the &quot;gothic box&quot; has been hidden all along in the Alabama home that Karr returned to after JonBenet Ramsey's murder?</p>
<p>Karr confirmed to Lei Sussurra that Brooke Dovgan searched his Alabama and Atlanta homes. Dovgan discovered Karr's handwriting samples that experts in America analyzed to link the Ramsey ransom note to Karr. Did Dovgan miss other physical evidence that would solve the fourteen year old murder case?</p>
<p>The media reported in 2006 that Karr's wife, who shared the Alabama home with him and their three children, said he was with her on Christmas 1996. Lara Knutson, stated that she and Karr were at their Alabama home or his parents' Atlanta house that year, according to Knutson's attorney Michael Rains. But Knutson's alibi began to shake as Rains further stated, &quot;But if you are to say to her, 'Are you absolutely certain?' she would say, &quot;No,&quot; She has not said to the authorities that her memory is infallible.&quot;</p>
<p>Karr's only alibi continued to deteriorate when Boulder District Attorney Mary Lacy revealed more doubt from Knutson about her then husband's whereabouts on the night of December 25th, 1996. Lacy stated at a press conference, &quot;The wife and he were to a great degree estranged at the time. So the former wife who we find to be very credible and very helpful and very cooperative, she did everything she could to dig up every document, photo she could find and she interviewed with officers for some 10-12 hours was unable to establish and when actually asked, &quot;Can you state he was with you?&quot;, she had to say &quot;No, I can't. That's not my best recollection,&quot; is what she said, &quot;but I cannot state that.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Trophy hunters might have their chance to plunder through the debris of the possibly destroyed Karr residence in Alabama. In 2006, pine cones from the yard of the Alabama home were placed for sale on Ebay. If law enforcement was negligent to search this home in 2006, they will not secure the area to prevent this.</p>
<p>In 2001, John Mark Karr was held for six months in the Sonoma County Jail while the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and law enforcement across the nation launched a U.S. national investigation for the murders of unidentified little girls in Alabama and Georgia and a twelve year old girl whose body was found below Karr's Petaluma residence in 1997. Karr's Petaluma homes were searched by authorities who found a computer hard drive that contained alleged images of child pornography. Karr fled the U.S. in 2001 on a nonstop flight to London and did not return until he was apprehended in Thailand by the Department of Homeland Security and a detective from Boulder County District Attorney's Office in 2006 on a warrant for the first degree murder of JonBenet Ramsey. When Karr was finally found in 2006 to face the 2001 child pornography charges, the evidence mysteriously vanished, blamed by Sonoma County Sheriff's Department on the move of thousands of pieces of evidence from an old evidence room to a new one. The law enforcement blunder was investigated for one year with no additional information or conclusions. Karr's attorneys told him that the case was &quot;open and shut&quot; whether the evidence was lost or not. The prosecution's photo experts were unable to determine that the photos were of under aged girls.</p>
<p>Questions loom over the only man ever arrested for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey. The child victim's father, John Ramsey, stated that he was disappointed that the case against Karr vaporized so quickly. Why did authorities neglect to search Karr's Alabama and Atlanta homes while he was the prime suspect in the internationally anticipated murder case of the six year old beauty queen? Why did the computer evidence against Karr mysteriously vanish in a Sonoma County evidence room, the only evidence disappearance among thousands of other articles of evidence? Why is the confessed killer of JonBenet Ramsey made immune to further investigation or arrest? Is Karr innocent of all charges or is he a sly killer who stays one step ahead of the law?</p>
<p>Update 05/09/11: Karr informs Lei Sussurra that his Alabama home was not destroyed by a tornado. Minor roof damage and trees destroyed in front of residence reported. Possible Ramsey evidence remains intact.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF SUBJECT </h4>
<p>John Mark Karr was arrested in 2006 for the murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey. Karr provided evidential information retained from the public by law enforcement and the coroner for over a decade giving authorities grounds to obtain an arrest warrant. A stunned world watched as Karr confessed to the murder though his incessant sharing seemingly ceased resulting in his release with law enforcement citing that there was not enough evidence to try him for first degree murder, kidnapping and sex assault. While the Boulder District Attorney and Boulder Police discount Karr's responsibility, certain detectives and handwriting experts still disagree.</p>
<p>Karr rocked tabloid news in late March 2010 when it was discovered that he had changed his name, not once but two times, and possibly changed his sex to female. One of the new given names is amazingly similar in spelling to Karr's pseudonym, Daxis.</p>
<p>In the months following what was thought to be an exposure of a new identity now doubted, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel revealed to the world that Karr leads a devoted flock of followers in a violent sex cult known as &quot;The Immaculates&quot; that harvests little girls for Karr's delight and would kill to defend their beloved leader.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, a December 2010 article by SF Weekly dubbed Karr accuser Samantha Spiegel, a killer groupie after she revealed that she maintained a murderous circle of friends that includes little girl killer Richard Allen Davis, the night stalker Richard Ramirez and cult leader [sound familiar?] Charles Manson. Possibly the most bizarre of Spiegel's revelations was her desire to have the baby of Polly Klaas killer, Richard Allen Davis.</p>
<p>Karr returned to Paris in the spring of 2010 when he found he'd flown from Europe to America to face criminal charges that did not exist.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2010, Lei Sussurra released four Karr handwriting samples that were linked to the Ramsey ransom note in 2007 by four prominent handwriting experts. On January 3rd, 2011, the Circle of Fire, contributor to The Daxis Report, confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice downloaded the Karr handwriting samples from the Lei Sussurra website. It is unknown what the DOJ's intentions are concerning the samples.</p>

<H4 align="center" style="color: #600;">ABOUT LEI SUSSURRA</H4>
<p>Lei Sussurra is a journalistic effort based outside the United States. Since 2009, we have conducted an ongoing news investigation of JonBenet Ramsey murder suspect John Mark Karr aka Daxis. Portions of article content are based on information and statements provided directly by Karr and do not express the views of Lei Sussurra. The source has been verified. Article content has been occasionally based on tips and information received via e-mail and phone. Lei Sussurra extends unlimited anonymity to those who provide information related to Karr unless otherwise requested by the source or by law enforcement.</p>
<p>In Spring 2010, San Francisco Police Department in the United States obtained several search warrants that included one for Google that was aimed at the Lei Sussurra website, though we author our site outside the U.S. Thought by some in law enforcement and the media to be authored by Karr himself, the site was scrutinized for IP hit information through uploads of text and graphics though the site has never conducted any illegal activity. Law enforcement also secured a search warrant for Hewlett-Packard to link a computer believed to belong to Karr to possibly prove that he created some of the graphics files for the site though there have never been any illegal graphics files uploaded to the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra received both phone and e-mail messages from members of the media, including the Associated Press. The requests asked if the site was authored by Karr and requested proof that would confirm that statements quoted on the site were actually those of Karr. Because of Karr's legal position in the summer of 2010 and a criminal investigation against him for alleged cult activity that followed months afterward, Lei Sussurra was virtually gagged in its response to any requests or publication of any articles to avoid further legal involvement in what had become a criminal investigation aimed not only at Karr but also at the Lei Sussurra website.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra is not only the focus of law enforcement. High powered law firms eye the site with negative intent as Lei Sussurra gears up for lawsuits. The site created to be a source of information about John Mark Karr has become an incriminating trap that is intimidated by threats from the outside to remain silent or pay the penalty.</p>
<p>Lei Sussurra maintains an open communication policy with U.S. and international law enforcement and will respond accordingly and without hesitation if there is evidence of and not limited to -- any activity that might threaten the safety of a child.</p>
<p>The Daxis Report provides information about individuals, groups, agencies and efforts that concern themselves with John Mark Karr, also known as Daxis. Findings are based on statistical data, patterns presented over time, the synchronization of actions with events occurring in Karr's life at a given time, and other investigative methods. Reports include friend and foe alike with no distinction made between the two in certain cases. Findings are neutral unless otherwise expressed by obvious intent or by persons, groups or agencies through actions, media interviews, web pages, blogs, forums, or any other form of public expression. Information and conclusions in this report do not imply malicious intent toward any individual, group or agency.</p>
